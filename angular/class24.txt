Program	:
	 AcadviewTest (todo application)

NOTE	:
	 -todo application created in the AcadviewTest folder
	 -filter in angular (|) : to solve the problem of the  function execution twice.
	  example : {{ input1 | function_name : input2 }}
	 -to search in the content use filter function of angular.
		filter : function name
		input to function : (string,array)
		output of function : (array)
	 -IMPORTANT : filter can not be used in the ng-model because it take input as string and array and return array but ng-model is holding a variable.
		    : but this will work :- ng-repeat=" engineer in engineers | filter: query" 
					    because first (engineers | filter : query) will execute, then remaining expression will execute.
	 -$index is a variable provided by the angular which will give the index of current location used with ng-repeat.
